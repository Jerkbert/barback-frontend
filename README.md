Welcome to Barback!

Created by Robert Ballantyne, using React on the frontend and Rails on the backend. 

Barback is an app that helps bar managers keep track of all items in their inventory and cost out drinks for their menus. 

A user can log in or create a new bar. 
Once logged in a user can add items to the inventory. 
The inventory is autmatically sorted A-Z, but new items will be added to the bottom of the list. 
These items can be filtered by product type, searched by name, or sorted A-Z.
To override the search/filter functions a user can click on 'refresh products' to display the inventory. 

Each item can be edited or deleted. 

Drink Mode will toggle a drink builder mode.
The product options change from 'edit' and 'delete' to 'select quantity' and 'add to drink'
A card appears to the right of the inventory once an ingredient has been added. 
This card displays the cost of each ingredient, the total cost of the drink, and a recommended price based on a standard margin of 20%.
